-----------------------------------------------------------------

Ricci_rot is an OpenGL application which visualizes Ricci flow
on surfaces of revolution. It is written in ANSI C, and makes use
of OpenGL and the GLUT utility toolkit.
So far, it has only been tested on Mac OS X machines.

It was written by Robert M. Sinclair, who can be contacted (valid
2005) at the Department of Mathematical Sciences, Faculty of Science,
University of the Ryukyus, Nishihara City, Okinawa 903-0213, Japan:
sinclair@math.u-ryukyu.ac.jp or R.Sinclair@ms.unimelb.edu.au .

In this zipfile, we include the source code ricci_rot.c and a
working Mac OS X application produced from it (this is the directory
Ricci_rot.app). The Mac OS X application was built using Xcode 1.1 under
Mac OS X Version 10.3.9 in August 2005.

The program should be easily portable to other operating systems
with an appropriate C compiler and OpenGL libraries. Details will
of course depend upon the particular operating system etc.
